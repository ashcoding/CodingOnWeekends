# COW (Coding On Weekends)
Stuff I'm "Coding On Weekends". Let's abbreviate it to "COW".

This repo contains random short projects done on weekends (or whenever I'm free).

Feel free to comment and let me know if there's a better way for me to code certain things. Or better yet, drop me a PR!

## Naming Projects ##
I'm just gonna name the projects after [MRT Stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Singapore_MRT_stations).

First project is called NS1. Followed by NS2 and so on.

## Project ##

1. [NS1](../NS1)
  - This Project is about handling sensitive keys in Android Projects and not hardcoding them into the app.
